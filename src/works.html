                    Monad is a PSX inspired 3D adventure platformer developed in Unity. A fully fledged experience
                    featuring nostalgic gameplay elements from
                    titles such as Resident Evil. This project was constructed by
                    weekly sprints over
                    the course of 3 months, within a team of 9.

                    What started off as a slow crawl, quickly developed into a full sprint. As this was the most
                    ambitious project
                    I've been fortunate enough to be apart of up to this point. This experience solidifed my passion for
                    game programming!

                    Ibunn is a first person perspective dungeon crawler prototype

                    Puppy Pets Puzzle Program (P4) is a connect-3 matching game made in Unity. Designed around the
                    overarching
                    concept of a quick game that can be played at an adoption center. Developed
                    in 10 weekly sprints within a team of 3.
